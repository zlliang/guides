# LLM-Generated Markdown Guides

This repository contains a collection of **educational guides and tutorials** generated by AI assistants.
Each topic is available in both **English** and **Simplified Chinese**, providing clear, well-structured references for learning and exploration.

I created this repository and initialized it with [this Amp thread](https://ampcode.com/threads/T-fb3c4282-e642-49d9-ae84-bb5d662c066b), which generated the first set of guides.

To add a new guide, simply request a topic from an **AI assistant that follows the rules defined in [AGENTS.md](https://agents.md/)**.
The assistant will generate both language versions and automatically update this table.
